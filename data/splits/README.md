# Data splits
The data splits only contain ids for gold data per language.
The splits are based on the `experiment` files in the PMB: `exp_data_4.0.0.zip` from https://pmb.let.rug.nl/releases/.

Note that not all docs are usable due to the data issues mentioned in the main README, so the actual counts are slightly lower.
